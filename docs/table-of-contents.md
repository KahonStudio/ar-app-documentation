# Table of Contents  

Welcome to the **AR App Technical Drawing Series**. This guide is designed to help learners develop a solid foundation in technical drawing, whether for academic study, professional growth, or personal interest. The content is organized into **twelve comprehensive sections**, each carefully structured to introduce key concepts, practical techniques, and hands-on exercises.  

---
### **01. Technical Drawing**  
  Learn what technical drawing is, why it plays an important role in engineering, architecture, and design, and explore a brief history of its development from traditional hand-drawn methods to modern digital drafting.

### **02. Materials and Tools**  
  Discover the essential equipment needed to begin technical drawing, from pencils, rulers, compasses, and set squares to drafting boards and CAD software. This section will also highlight the importance of accuracy, maintenance of tools, and selecting the right materials for different drawing purposes.

### **03. Orthographic Drawing**  
  Gain a clear understanding of orthographic projections, which represent three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. Lessons will cover how to construct top, front, and side views accurately, as well as how to interpret and analyze drawings in order to communicate designs effectively.

### **04. Perspective**  
  Explore the fundamental concepts of perspective drawing. Learn about linear perspective terminology and how perspective creates the illusion of depth and space in two-dimensional drawings.

### **05. One-Point Perspective View**  
  Discover one-point perspective, where all parallel lines converge to a single vanishing point on the horizon. This technique is perfect for drawing objects viewed directly from the front, creating depth with a single point of convergence.

### **06. Steps on How to Create a Basic One-Point Perspective**  
  Follow step-by-step instructions to create your own one-point perspective drawings. This practical guide will walk you through the process from setting up your horizon line and vanishing point to completing a finished perspective drawing.

### **07. Two-Point Perspective View**  
  Master two-point perspective, where objects are viewed from an angle with two vanishing points. This technique is ideal for drawing buildings, boxes, and other rectangular objects from a corner view, creating more dynamic and realistic representations.

### **08. Steps on How to Create a Basic Two-Point Perspective**  
  Learn the detailed process of creating two-point perspective drawings. This guide provides clear, sequential steps to help you construct accurate two-point perspective views, from establishing your vanishing points to adding depth and detail.

### **09. Three-Point Perspective View**  
  Explore three-point perspective, the most dramatic form of perspective drawing. This technique uses three vanishing points to create extreme angles and dramatic views, perfect for drawing tall buildings from ground level or looking down from above.
