# Technical Drawing

Technical drawing, or drafting, is an exact visual representation that shows how an object works or is constructed. These drawings are created to scale and use clear elements that allow only one interpretation. This precision is what sets technical drawing apart from artistic drawing, which is mainly intended to provide aesthetic appeal.

## Why it matters for perspective

Perspective drawing relies on accuracy to show depth, proportion, and spatial relationships realistically. Technical drawing is important here because it trains you to use precise measurements, clean lines, and correct scales, which are essential in constructing believable perspectives.

## The History and Evolution of Technical Drawing

Technical drawing has a long and distinguished history, tracing its roots back to the 15th century when Leonardo da Vinci, the Italian inventor and artist, created mechanical sketches that continue to fascinate both art historians and engineers.

Over time, technical drawing developed alongside scientific progress. Notable milestones include the Cartesian coordinate system, introduced in the 16th century by French philosopher Ren√© Descartes, and the invention of descriptive geometry in the 18th century by French mathematician Gaspard Monge.

The Industrial Revolution further advanced the practice, as the demand for precise designs enabled mass production of components. Later, the Second World War and the space race acted as turning points that pushed technical drawing into new levels of importance and sophistication.

A major breakthrough came in the early 1980s with the rise of Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD or CAD) software. This innovation transformed technical drawing into a digital process, making it faster, more accurate, and widely accessible. Today, CAD remains an essential tool for engineers, designers, and professionals across many fields.
