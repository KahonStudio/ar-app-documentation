# Technical Drawing

Technical drawing, or drafting, is an exact visual representation that shows how an object works or is constructed. These drawings are created to scale and use clear elements that allow only one interpretation. This precision is what sets technical drawing apart from artistic drawing, which is mainly intended to provide aesthetic appeal.

Perspective drawing relies on accuracy to show depth, proportion, and spatial relationships realistically. Technical drawing is important here because it trains you to use precise measurements, clean lines, and correct scales, which are essential in constructing believable perspectives.

Technical drawing emphasizes precision, scale, and clarity, which are the foundations of accurate representation in perspective. However, aside from showing objects in three-dimensional perspective, technical drawing also uses orthographic projection. Orthographic drawing presents different views of the same object such as the front, top, and side on a flat surface.

This method eliminates distortion and provides exact dimensions, ensuring that every angle of the object can be understood and constructed correctly. In this way, orthographic projection complements perspective drawing by focusing on measurable accuracy, making it an essential tool in technical drawing for engineering, architecture, and design.

Perspective drawing makes objects look realistic by showing depth, space, and proportion, while orthographic drawing shows the same object from different flat views like the front, top, and side. The two are connected because perspective helps us see how something would appear in real life, while orthographic projection helps us measure and build it exactly. Together, they make technical drawing both creative and practical—perspective shows the “look,” and orthographic shows the “details.”
