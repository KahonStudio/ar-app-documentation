<p>Foreshortening is a drawing technique used in perspective art to create the illusion that an object or figure is receding strongly into the distance or coming forward toward the viewer. It happens when part of the subject is closer to the viewer and appears shorter or compressed, even though in reality it’s not. This visual distortion helps make drawings look more realistic and three-dimensional.</p>

<p>While the four-step method for drawing the figure is most effective from a standard viewpoint, it can still be applied when working with extreme angles, provided we understand how distortion affects drawn lines.</p>
<ol>
<li>Measure the overall length: Visually measure the figure from head to toe. Estimate the subject’s overall length and sketch a line on your surface to represent this measurement. Depending on the pose, this line may curve slightly. In extreme perspective, this measured line will appear much shorter.</li>
<li>Place shoulder and waist lines: Sketch lines for the shoulders and the waist. These may curve slightly depending on the figure’s position. The viewer’s vantage point strongly influences where these lines fall; for example, from above, shoulders appear wider while the waist-to-feet distance compresses.</li>
<li>Establish the structure: Plan the figure’s structure with a simple stick figure. Use a geometric shape for the torso rather than a single line. Apply similar shapes for hands and feet to provide a clear foundational structure.</li>
<li>Flesh out and refine: Add confident contour lines to flesh out the form. Then refine clothing, facial features, and props. Enhance realism by introducing a range of values to create the illusion of light and shadow on the figure.</li>
