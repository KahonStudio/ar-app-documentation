<h3 id="_04-perspective" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_04-perspective"><span><strong>04. Perspective</strong></span></a></h3>
<p>Explore the fundamental concepts of perspective drawing. Learn about linear perspective terminology and how perspective creates the illusion of depth and space in two-dimensional drawings.</p>

<h3 id="_05-one-point-perspective-view" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_05-one-point-perspective-view"><span><strong>05. One-Point Perspective View</strong></span></a></h3>
<p>Discover one-point perspective, where all parallel lines converge to a single vanishing point on the horizon. This technique is perfect for drawing objects viewed directly from the front, creating depth with a single point of convergence.</p>
