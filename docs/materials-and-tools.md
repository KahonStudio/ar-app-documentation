# Materials and Tools

## Sketchbook
A book with blank paper pages for drawing and sketching, serving as a personal journal for artists to document ideas, practice techniques, and explore creativity without the pressure of creating finished work.

## Pencil
A set of graphite pencils (HB, 2B, 4B) for light sketching and darker outlines. Consists of a core of graphite (and sometimes clay) encased in wood or other casing. No need to have all types of the pencils, as having three types close in range would suffice.

## Eraser
A soft eraser for clean corrections; kneaded erasers are good for lightening lines.

## Ruler
For straight perspective lines and vanishing points.
