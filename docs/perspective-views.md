# Perspective Views

## Linear Perspective Terms
Visual depth can be created using linear perspective, atmospheric perspective, and color. In linear perspective, depth is shown through the use of lines, as well as the size and position of objects. While drawings may differ in complexity, the following basic terms are essential to understanding linear perspective:

- Horizon – The line where the sky meets the land or water. Its height determines the position of the vanishing point(s) and represents the viewer’s eye level.
- Vanishing Point – The spot on the horizon where parallel lines appear to converge in the distance. A scene may have one or multiple vanishing points.
- Ground Plane – The flat horizontal surface beneath the horizon, such as land or water. If the surface is sloped or uneven, the vanishing point formed by parallel lines may shift.
- Orthogonal Lines – Lines that recede toward the vanishing point (e.g., railroad tracks). The term relates to right angles, as seen in cube corners.
- Vantage Point – The position from which a viewer observes the scene. Unlike the vanishing point, the vantage point is determined by the viewer’s location and is influenced by the horizon’s placement and the vanishing points.

## A. One-Point Perspective
A form of linear perspective that relies on only one vanishing point, usually near the center of the scene. A common example is looking straight down a railway track, where the parallel rails appear to converge at a single point on the horizon.

### Steps
1. Find a vertical line on the side of the object nearest the observer.
2. Find the angle of one of the receding-plane lines to the vertical line.
3. Find the second angle from the opposite end of the vertical, as in step 2. Draw the horizon line through the point.
4. Draw the side that is parallel to the picture plane off the vertical.
5. Connect the corners to the vanishing point, and establish other receding planes.
6. Mark the depth to the receding planes by sighting the width of the side of the object; this length will mark the corners of the back side.
7. Erase working lines as shown.

## B. Two-Point Perspective
This type of linear perspective uses two vanishing points, usually positioned on the far left and far right sides of the horizon.

### Steps
1. Find the vertical line closest to the picture plane.
2. Find the angle of one of the receding planes to the vertical line.
3. Find the second angle on the same side of the vertical line, as in step 2. The point at which they intersect establishes the vanishing point and the horizon line.
4. Take the angle off the other side of the vertical line. The point at which the angle strikes the horizon is the second vanishing point.
5. Connect the remaining corner to the second vanishing point.
6. Take the proportional widths of each of the receding planes and mark with a vertical line to form the right and left corners.
7. Connect these new corners to the appropriate vanishing points to form the back planes.

## C. Three-Point Perspective
Three-point perspective creates the illusion of depth for extreme viewpoints (e.g., looking up at tall buildings or down from a height). In addition to left and right vanishing points on the horizon, a third vanishing point sits above or below the horizon for vertical convergence.

### Steps
1. Find the second plane angle on the same side of the vertical line and establish the vanishing point and the horizon line.
2. Find the angle on the opposite side of the vertical line to establish the other vanishing point on the horizon line.
3. To find the vertical vanishing point: take the proportion of the side and read the angle against either the receding plane or a horizontal line.
4. The vertical vanishing point is where these vertical angles intersect on a line perpendicular to the horizon.
5. Confirm the vertical vanishing point where the vertical angles intersect on a line perpendicular to the horizon.

## Practice: Perspective Drawing Exercise
Explore the illusion of depth by sketching squares with lines extending toward a single vanishing point. Depth is created through linear perspective and value.

### Materials
- Paper: 8” × 8” medium texture drawing paper; 8” × 8” medium-texture sketch paper
- Pencils: 2B and 4B
- Kneaded eraser
- Lightbox or transfer paper
- Ruler
- Triangle
- T-square

### Steps
1. Sketch the Squares: On sketch paper, use a 2B to draw an 8″ × 8″ square, then create smaller squares by marking equal intervals (½″, 2″, ½″, 2″, ½″, 2″) on all sides; connect precisely with a T-square and triangle.
2. Add the Vanishing Point and Orthogonal Lines: Place a dot at the center for the vanishing point; add orthogonals from the square corners to the point, avoiding the forward white surface.
3. Add More Orthogonals: Continue adding lines that converge at the vanishing point.
4. Trace or Transfer: Lightly trace/transfer the structure onto drawing paper; omit unwanted lines.
5. Add Light Values: Add lighter values with 2B; darken as forms recede.
6. Add Middle Values: Continue building middle values; darken tunnel-like forms as they recede.
7. Add Dark Values: Deepen darks with 2B/4B; lift as needed with a kneaded eraser.
