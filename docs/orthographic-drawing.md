# Orthographic Drawing

## What is Orthographic Drawing?
Orthographic drawing is a technique used to represent 3D objects in 2D, using multiple views, typically top, front, and side projections. This method is commonly used in engineering, architecture, and design to show the exact dimensions and relationships of an object without distortion.

The main orthographic views—Top, Front, and Sides—allow viewers to understand the object’s shape, depth, and dimensions. (see image below)

## Guide: How to create an orthographic drawing

### Step 1: Visualize the object from top, front and side

### Step 2: Draw guidelines/grid lines for accurate angle

### Step 3: Draw the top, front, and side view

### Step 4: Add details like texture for dimensioning

### Step 1: Choose an Object
Choose an object around you (e.g., a cup, book, or pencil). The object should have distinct sides that are easy to represent in three views (Top, Front, Side).

### Step 2: Sketch the Object
Using Ibis Paint or PicsArt, start by sketching the object in one of the three views.
- Front View: Place the object in front and draw a simple, accurate representation.
- Top View: Draw how the object would look from above.
- Side View: Draw how the object would look from the side.

### Step 3: Create the Projections
After sketching the basic views, place your views side-by-side.

Using the app’s tools:
- Layering: Create separate layers for each view to keep them organized.
- Grid Tool: Use the grid to help with scale and proportion.

- Shapes Tool: Use predefined shapes (rectangles, circles) for basic structures to keep the drawing accurate

### Step 4: Add Details and Dimensioning
Refine sketches by adding details like edges, contours, or textures that help represent depth or form.
