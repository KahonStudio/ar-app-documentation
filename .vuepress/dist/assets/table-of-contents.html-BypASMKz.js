This guide is designed to help learners develop a solid foundation in technical drawing, whether for academic study, professional growth, or personal interest. The content is organized into <strong>five comprehensive lessons</strong>, each carefully structured to introduce key concepts, practical techniques, and hands-on exercises.</p><hr><h3 id="technical-drawing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-drawing"><span><strong>Technical Drawing</strong></span></a></h3><p>Learn what technical drawing is, why it plays an important role in engineering, architecture, and design, and explore a brief history of its development from traditional hand-drawn methods to modern digital drafting.</p><div class="custom-actions"><a href="/technical-drawing.html" class="action-button primary">Technical Drawing</a></div><h3 id="materials-and-tools" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#materials-and-tools"><span><strong>Materials and Tools</strong></span></a></h3><p>Discover the essential equipment needed to begin technical drawing, from pencils, rulers, compasses, and set squares to drafting boards and CAD software. This section will also highlight the importance of accuracy, maintenance of tools, and selecting the right materials for different drawing purposes.</p><div class="custom-actions"><a href="/materials-and-tools.html" class="action-button primary">Materials and Tools</a></div><h3 id="orthographic-drawing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#orthographic-drawing"><span><strong>Orthographic Drawing</strong></span></a></h3><p>Gain a clear understanding of orthographic projections, which represent three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. Lessons will cover how to construct top, front, and side views accurately, as well as how to interpret and analyze drawings in order to communicate designs effectively.</p><div class="custom-actions"><a href="/orthographic-drawing.html" class="action-button primary">Orthographic Drawing</a></div><h3 id="perspective-views" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#perspective-views"><span><strong>Perspective Views</strong></span></a></h3><p>Explore how to create the illusion of depth and space through perspective drawing. Topics include linear perspective terminology, one-point, two-point, and three-point perspectives, and step-by-step practice exercises to help you visualize and sketch realistic objects in space.</p><div class="custom-actions"><a href="/perspective-views.html" class="action-button primary">Perspective Views</a></div><h3 id="foreshortening" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#foreshortening"><span><strong>Foreshortening</strong></span></a></h3><p>Master the technique of foreshortening to create convincing depth and dynamic forms in your drawings. Learn how compressed shapes can be used to make objects appear closer or farther away, and practice exercises to apply this concept in both simple geometric figures and complex organic forms.</p><div class="custom-actions"><a href="/foreshortening.html" class="action-button primary">Foreshortening</a></div>',18)])])}const l=a(s,[["render",r]]),h=JSON.parse('{"path":"/table-of-contents.html","title":"Table of Contents","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":3,"title":"Technical Drawing","slug":"technical-drawing","link":"#technical-drawing","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Materials and Tools","slug":"materials-and-tools","link":"#materials-and-tools","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Orthographic Drawing","slug":"orthographic-drawing","link":"#orthographic-drawing","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Perspective Views","slug":"perspective-views","link":"#perspective-views","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Foreshortening","slug":"foreshortening","link":"#foreshortening","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1759385756000,"contributors":[{"name":"KahonStudio","username":"KahonStudio","email":"itsmeibay@gmail.com","commits":1,"url":"https://github.com/KahonStudio"}],"changelog":[{"hash":"e23538212698ae3fb9d8d8adb05da6851ac20b02","time":1759385756000,"email":"itsmeibay@gmail.com","author":"KahonStudio","message":"table of contents and homepage"}]},"filePathRelative":"table-of-contents.md"}');export{l as comp,h as data};
