In linear perspective, depth is shown through the use of lines, as well as the size and position of objects. While drawings may differ in complexity, the following basic terms are essential to understanding linear perspective:</p><ul><li><p>Horizon – The line where the sky meets the land or water. Its height determines the position of the vanishing point(s) and represents the viewer’s eye level.</p></li><li><p>Vanishing Point – The spot on the horizon where parallel lines appear to converge in the distance. A scene may have one or multiple vanishing points.</p></li><li><p>Ground Plane – The flat horizontal surface beneath the horizon, such as land or water. If the surface is sloped or uneven, the vanishing point formed by parallel lines may shift.</p></li><li><p>Orthogonal Lines – Lines that recede toward the vanishing point (e.g., railroad tracks). The term relates to right angles, as seen in cube corners.</p></li><li><p>Vantage Point – The position from which a viewer observes the scene. Unlike the vanishing point, the vantage point is determined by the viewer’s location and is influenced by the horizon’s placement and the vanishing points.</p></li><li><p>Source: <code>https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-mediums/learn-to-draw-perspective/</code></p></li></ul><hr><h2 id="a-one-point-perspective" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-one-point-perspective"><span>A. One-Point Perspective</span></a></h2><p>A form of linear perspective that relies on only one vanishing point, usually near the center of the scene.
